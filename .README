Stretch Your Thoughts: answer the following questions: 

1. What type of resources can you host with Express?
    Databases

2. What are the benefits of using a View Engine overusing Vanilla technologies?

        If the front end is lots of content that may come from a database but is mostly static once it hits the page (e.g. blog, news/review or other article based content), use a templating engine. Also use back end templating if you are selling anything (more secure)

        If the front end has lots of user interaction or custom displays so the DOM changes often after initial render (e.g. dashboard or real-time feed), use a front end framework.

        You would also use a front end framework in a sales site for things like infinite scroll or real time filtering as users prefer a seamless app-like reload rather than full page refreshes. You would still revert to back end render for the sales pages (basket handling)

2. Why does the Express Generator split up the functionality into so many files?

    The express generator does a great job of giving you the very essential boilerplate code, but if your application starts to grow beyond just a few routes youâ€™ll soon find that you need a better routing strategy than putting all route handlers in the app.js file.
